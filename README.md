Hello,

the lastest branch is database_firebase, plz make sure you download it for full features

In order to run it, plz obtain a google map api key from google cloud console

This is how the api looks like on Google Developers Console:

(if you are not sure how to do it, this video might help:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNlz7-abd0)

After getting the api key, plz paste the api key in the string.xml:

<img width="895" alt="keyString" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8214274f-8269-43c0-83ed-2a16545e99e9" />

Also paste it in google-services.json, which you can find in the app folder:

<img width="368" alt="keyJson" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5844bb90-a34e-47dc-b617-dae282b30151" />
